# Chess Console Application

This repository contains a small project developed during a fundamentals course on C#. The project is a console-based chess game implemented in C#.

## Course Overview

The Fundamentals of C# course provided a foundational understanding of the C# programming language. As part of the course, a chess game project was developed to showcase basic programming concepts and techniques using C#. The chess game operates within a console environment.

## Features

- **C# Programming**: Learn fundamental concepts of the C# programming language.
- **Console Application**: Develop a chess game that operates via the console.
- **Chess Logic**: Implement the logic and rules of chess.
- **Console Input/Output**: Utilize console input/output mechanisms to interact with the chess game.

## Prerequisites

Before running the Chess Console Application, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- .NET 5 SDK or later: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download

## Getting Started

To get started with the Chess Console Application, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/lucasmiko/xadrez-console-csharp.git`
2. Access the project directory: `cd xadrez-console-csharp`
3. Build the solution: `dotnet build`
4. Run the application: `dotnet run`

Once the application is running, you can use the console to play the chess game and make moves according to the standard chess rules.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- **Program.cs**: The main entry point of the console application.
- **Board.cs**: The class responsible for managing the chessboard and pieces.
- **ChessPiece.cs**: The base class for defining chess pieces and their behavior.
- **Enums/**: Directory containing enum definitions for the chess game.
- **Entities/**: Directory containing the classes representing chess pieces.
